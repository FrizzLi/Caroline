I want to further clarify the translation and create additional explanation for my vocabulary list this way:
Additional_translations - find translations except for the ones that are already mentioned, stick to their original meaning
Explanation - give one sentence explanation for the expression
Explanation_of_syllables - give one sentence explanation for each syllable if it commonly carries general meaning
Example_for_image - create simple example according to the Explanation, with extensive description with concrete details (with no "or" words) that will be used for drawing an image by text prompt
Example_for_sentence_with_Korean_translation - create a short simple sentence example of usage according to the Explanation

Do it for these words:
주부	housewife
배우	actor, actress
문화	culture
