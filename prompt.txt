I want to further clarify the translation and create additional explanation for my vocabulary list this way:
Additional_translations - find similar translations other than the ones in Translation, but stick to their meaning
Explanation - give one sentence explanation for the expression
Explanation_of_syllables - give one sentence explanation for each syllable in the Expression only if it commonly carries general meaning
Example_for_image - create example according to the Explanation that is easily expressed by an image with at least 3 sentences. Provide extensive description with many objects with concrete details. The description is meant to be used as the text prompt for image generation by AI. Be deterministic, don't use general expressions that could be drawn in many ways, avoid using words like "or".
Example_for_sentence_with_Korean_translation - create a very short simple sentence example of usage according to the Explanation in Korean, and put its translation into brackets

Do it for these words:
Expression: 거울, Translation: mirror
Expression: 크다, Translation: to be big / large
Expression: 아프다, Translation: to be sick, ill, painful
