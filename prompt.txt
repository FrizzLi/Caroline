I want to create additional information of words in my vocabulary list.
Additional_translations:

Explanation_of_Expression:
Give one sentence explanation for the expression

Explanation_of_Syllables:
Give one sentence explanation for each syllable in the Expression only if it commonly carries general meaning

Example_for_Image:
Create an example according to the Explanation which is easily expressed by an image. Use only three sentences! Provide extensive description with many objects with concrete details, with extra emphasis on the Expression. The description is meant to be used as the Text Prompt for image generation by AI. Be deterministic, don't use general expressions that could be drawn in many ways, avoid using words like "or".

Image_tags:
According to generated Example_for_Image text, create ten tags that are closely related only with the Explanation_of_Expression.
