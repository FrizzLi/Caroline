Explanation_of_Expression:
Give one sentence explanation for the expression

Explanation_of_syllables:
Give one sentence explanation for each syllable in the Expression only if it commonly carries general meaning

Example_for_image:
create example according to the Explanation that is easily expressed by an image with three  sentences. Provide extensive description with many objects with concrete details, with extra emphasis on the Expression. The description is meant to be used as the Text Prompt for image generation by AI. Be deterministic, don't use general expressions that could be drawn in many ways, avoid using words like "or".

Image_tags:
According to generated Example_for_image text, create ten tags that are very closely related with the Explanation_of_Expression only.

Example_for_sentence_with_Korean_translation:

Do it for these words:
