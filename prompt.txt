I want to further clarify the translation and create additional explanation for my vocabulary list this way:
Additional_translations - find translations other than the ones in Translation, but stick to their meaning
Explanation - give one sentence explanation for the expression
Explanation_of_syllables - give one sentence explanation for each syllable in the Expression if it commonly carries general meaning
Example_for_image - create simple example according to the Explanation, with extensive description with concrete details (with no "or" words) that will be used for drawing an image by text prompt
Example_for_sentence_with_Korean_translation - create a short simple sentence example of usage according to the Explanation

Do it for these words:
Expression: 주부, Translation: housewife
Expression: 배우, Translation: actor, actress
Expression: 문화, Translation: culture
