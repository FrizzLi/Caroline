    - [ ] Take into account time; session number; only the first guesses
    - [ ] ~Add visualization on worksheet, streak play, dialy q, graph of practice intensity like on github 

  - [ ] Session:

    - [ ] Bug: Have to be connected to turn on reading lesson
    - [ ] Bug: Error when long time no use.. (listening)
    - [ ] Bug: Word counter is going up to just 50 (might not be necessary)
  
    - [ ] Research bot capabilities inside the chat
    - [ ] Track until all 2 checks in one session? Somehow,, then last 5 hardest words practice till 2 checks!
    - [ ] Words checked out of... (instead of missing to guess words instead)
    - [ ] Once know all in one session, pick the hardest ones to test again, or just display them
    - [ ] Disable buttons during mp3 play
    - [ ] All words again to refresh -> then gradually test ">", "X" etc.
    - [ ] Pause for listening -> back 10s
